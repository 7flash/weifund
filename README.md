The front end is just a sample. Nothing is working just yet.

#TODO
All core features should be exposed through the UI and access the companion contract:
- Link to a campaign via the URL
- Create a campaign
- Contribute to a campaign
- If sufficient funding received, payout to campaign recipient
- If expired, refund to contributors
- Display progress report of a campaign
