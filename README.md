# CrowdFundrr
A decentralized, fully transparent, open-source crowd funding DApp build on Ethereum.

# Front-End
http://crowdfundrr.github.io/

The front end is just a sample. Nothing is working just yet.

#SOL
Present SOL is just Chriseth's crowd funding example.

#Contract Functionality
All core features should be exposed through the UI and access the companion contract:
- Link to a campaign via the URL
- Create a campaign
- Contribute to a campaign
- If sufficient funding received, payout to campaign recipient
- If expired, refund to contributors
- Display progress report of a campaign

#TODO
- Further define JS Crowdfundrr object
- Hook up HTML/JS front-end to contract
- Campaign Interface

# COMPLETED TODO
- Develop contract to fit contract functionality in Solidity
- Build bootstrap front-end
- Branding/Name Logo
- REPO
